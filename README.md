# Animal Card

This is a project I submitted for a Udacity course. The goal was to recreate a card (from an image example they provided) describing an animal of our choosing, making sure that our code included:

  - the box-shadow property
  - padding & margins
  - border stylings

To take this a step further, I chose to use:
  - 2 Google fonts
  - splash colors
  - image hover effects
